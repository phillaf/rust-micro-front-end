## Architectural Summary

The Rust Micro Front-End Application has been built according to the specified requirements, implementing:

1. **User Management**:
   - Username-based identity system
   - Display name management with validation
   - JWT-based authentication for write operations

2. **Web Components**:
   - CMS Component for authenticated users to edit their display names
   - Display Component for public viewing of user display names
   - Component composability with other micro front-ends through event-based integration

3. **Technical Implementation**:
   - Server-side rendering with minijinja templates
   - Inline JavaScript for minimal dependencies
   - MySQL database with direct SQL queries (no ORM)
   - Containerized development and production environments
   - Comprehensive testing at unit, integration, and end-to-end levels

## Operational Readiness

The application is fully production-ready with:

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Comprehensive health checks
   - Operational runbooks for alerts and incidents

2. **Logging**:
   - Structured logging with correlation IDs
   - Log aggregation setup for centralized visibility
   - Security event logging and audit trails

3. **Backup & Recovery**:
   - Comprehensive backup procedures for database, configuration, and images
   - Point-in-time recovery capabilities
   - Validation procedures to ensure backup integrity

4. **Security**:
   - JWT validation with RSA/ES256
   - Security headers for browser protection
   - Rate limiting for abuse prevention
   - Input validation and sanitization

## Documentation
