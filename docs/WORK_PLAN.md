## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Technology Decisions Made
- **Template Engine**: minijinja chosen over handlebars (lighter weight, better Rust integration)
- **Error Handling**: anyhow chosen for application-level errors
- **Environment Loading**: Direct environment variable access (no dotenvy dependency)
- **Folder Structure**: To be discussed before implementation

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Containerized Development**: All commands through justfile and Docker
- **Granular Environment Variables**: No umbrella ENVIRONMENT variable
- **External Alerting**: Metrics exposed for Grafana, no internal alerting logic
- **Runtime Templating**: Required for dynamic data rendering

### Open Questions
- **Folder Structure**: Incremental approach - only create what's needed for current tasks
- **Template Organization**: How to structure template files (when we get to templates)
- **Static Assets**: Minimal static assets strategy (when needed)
- **Testing Strategy**: Integration test environment setup (Phase 4)
